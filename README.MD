# Case Study: Micro Center

[View the project online](https://michaelbalson.dev/projects/microcenter/story)

Micro Center is an online and retail store chain that offers computer, electronic, networking, and communication devices. They differ from their competition in that they carry products that target a much wider audience, offering products and services tailored for beginners as well as more knowledgeable enthusiasts and experts.

Anecdotally, Micro Center is famous for having very competitive prices, with the caveat being most of these deals are only found in their brick-and-mortar locations. Additionally, they are infamous for their few number of stores.

Recently, I have been thinking a lot about moving to a new area and considering aspects of places I've lived previously that I missed. One of those was being close to a Micro Center, which led me to ask, which locations would be most suitable for a possible new expansion of Micro Center?
